seaborn.boxplot :

A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that facilitates comparisons between variables
or across levels of a categorical variable. The box shows the quartiles of the dataset while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the 
distribution, except for points that are determined to be “outliers” using a method that is a function of the inter-quartile range.

seaborn.heatmap :

Plot rectangular data as a color-encoded matrix.
This is an Axes-level function and will draw the heatmap into the currently-active Axes.

Self-Organizing Map : 

A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a
low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, 
and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction. Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they 
apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning (such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense 
that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
